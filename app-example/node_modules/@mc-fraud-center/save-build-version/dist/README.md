# save-build-version

This is a simple Node.js script that parses `pom.xml` and `package.json`, compares project name and version number on both files and outputs the result as a comment at the ending of `dist/index.html` file.

It is useful when you want to quickly see the version of the artifact that was deployed into your EIB.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install -D @mc-fraud-center/save-build-version
```

## Usage

In your `package.json`, add a script that calls the `save-build-version` cli command at the ending of your build process. Example:

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "ng build",
    "jenkins": "run-s lint test build",
		"postjenkins": "save-build-version",
```
